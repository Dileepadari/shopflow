"""Generate README-light.md from README.md.

    python3 scripts/build_light_readme.py

GitHub has no theme toggle, so the toggle is a pair of pages that link to each
other. The two must stay identical apart from the screenshot paths and the
toggle line, which is why the light page is generated rather than maintained by
hand: edit README.md, run this, commit both. CI regenerates it and fails on a
diff, so the pair cannot drift.

The dark-mode ``<source>`` inside the logo ``<picture>`` is deliberately left
alone. It points at docs/assets/, not docs/screenshots/, and it is the browser's
own preference that picks it, not the page.
